# BOM

This is a project for my school

You start the server in a production environment with `NODE_ENV=production npm run dev`

To set a custom password for the server do `PASSWORD=yourpassword npm run dev`

**Note**: never have a timed question as the first question of the grade. It won't work.

## Todo:

-   [ ] Make design nice
-   [x] Projector screen page
    -   [x] Show question and correct answer(s) on result projector page
-   [ ] Win page (actually we probably won't have one)
-   [x] Graph of points
-   [ ] Create build script for server
-   [x] Make index pages have same slides as projector
-   [ ] Prevent against hacking (not sure how necessary this would be)
-   [x] Another page to put in front of each laptop that shows whether they got it right or wrong
-   [x] Timer
-   [x] Log file of scores in case it crashes
-   [ ] Manual changing of scores
